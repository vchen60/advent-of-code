# advent-of-code
## AoC progress, starting from 2015!

Hey there! This is my site for my Advent of Code solutions, largely written in Java.

Goals:
- create working solutions for all of 2016 and 2025 (trying to bring over solutions for 2016 from my AP CSA class)
- create a website to record all of my solutions
- refine my Java algorithm skills (and potentially try to write some other years using C?)
- learn Hardcaml
- get a free Hardcaml T-shirt (see following link: https://blog.janestreet.com/advent-of-fpga-challenge-2025/)

For my submission for the Advent of FPGA, please see below:
